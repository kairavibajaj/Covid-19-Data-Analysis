# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
This project includes a detailed analysis of the Covid-19 dataset imported from http://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily.csv . This website is updated regularly with the latest data on the Covid-19 cases in the various states and territories of the United States of America.
The data contains information on the positive cases, negative cases, hospitalized cases and the total tests performed in the states. It also records the daily increase in the number of positive cases and hospitalised people.
In this project, I have analysed how the number of positive cases are rising/falling by the day in the states.
I have also compared two attributes for the same state like the variation of the positive increase with the increase in total tests.
Next, I have calculated the fatality ratio and the recovery ratio and pllotted it on a bar graph, depicting the comparisons between 5 different states.
This project also includes a graph that depicts the trend of the last two weeks of tests conducted and results obtained.
